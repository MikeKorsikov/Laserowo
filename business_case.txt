Software Application Requirements for Laser Hair Removal Business (Poland)
Context:
I operate a small, solo laser hair removal business in Poland. My client base is growing, and I need a software application to automate and organize various aspects of my business, including appointments, finance, marketing, and client communication. My current tools are manual (Excel, Apple Calendar, Instagram, Facebook Messenger, SMS). This application will be exclusively for the business owner's use, with no direct client or vendor access. I am looking for assistance in generating the code/framework or providing a detailed architectural plan and pseudo-code.

Objective:
To create a comprehensive, owner-centric software application that automates and streamlines client management, scheduling, finance, marketing, and communication, developed in phases for MacBook, Web, and iOS.

Phased Product Development Roadmap
The product will be developed according to the following roadmap:

Phase 1: Desktop Application (Core Functionality & Local Control)
This phase focuses on building the foundational features for daily operations, primarily for the owner's use on a MacBook. Data will be managed and accessible by this application. AI and Chatbot functionality should be integrated from this phase.

Phase 2: Web Application (Enhanced Owner Accessibility)
Building upon Phase 1, this phase makes the application accessible via a web browser solely for the owner, ensuring remote management capabilities.

Phase 3: Mobile iOS Application (On-the-Go Owner Management & Advanced AI Features)
This phase develops a native iOS application for the owner, providing optimized mobile access and enhancing the AI chatbot functionality for intuitive interaction.

I. Functional Requirements

Scalability: The system should be able to handle a growing client base and increased appointment volume without significant performance degradation. Efficient use of mobile device resources for Phase 3.

3. Security
Data Protection: Client data (personal information, treatment history, financial data) must be securely stored and protected in compliance with GDPR regulations.

Access Control: Only authorized users should have access to sensitive data and functionalities. The database layer must enforce role-based permissions.

Encryption: Sensitive data must be encrypted in transit (e.g., SSL/TLS) and at rest.

Password Security: Passwords must be stored as strong, one-way hashes (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2) with proper salt.

Data Masking/Obfuscation: Strategies for masking or obfuscating Personally Identifiable Information (PII) in non-production environments or for specific limited-access scenarios.

7. User Management
User Types:

Privileged User (Admin): Full access, including direct backend access and configuration.

Regular User: Access to all business functionality (client management, appointments, finance, marketing, hardware tracking, reporting) through the application interface.

III. Database Design Principles
The database schema, tables, and implementation must adhere to the following best practices:

1. Normalization (Ideally to at least 3NF)
Atomic Values: All values in columns must be atomic (indivisible).

Eliminate Redundancy: Data should not be needlessly duplicated across tables. Client names (full_name) must NOT be stored in the appointments table; they will be retrieved by joining appointments.client_id with clients.client_id.

Functional Dependencies: Ensure non-key attributes are dependent only on the primary key.

2. Primary and Foreign Keys
Unique Primary Keys: Each table must have a clear, unique primary key (id column). These should be auto-incrementing integers or UUIDs.

Defined Foreign Keys: Foreign key relationships must be explicitly defined and used appropriately to link related data between tables.

Cascading Rules: Consider and define appropriate ON DELETE and ON UPDATE cascading rules for foreign keys.

3. Constraints and Validation
NOT NULL Constraints: Apply to essential fields (e.g., all ids, names, dates, amounts, mandatory contact info).

UNIQUE Constraints: Apply to fields that must be unique (e.g., clients.email, users.username, services.service_name, expense_categories.category_name, treatment_areas.area_name, payment_methods.method_name, hardware.serial_number).

CHECK Constraints: Apply to enforce data integrity for specific ranges or conditions (e.g., power_j_cm3 values within a valid range, amounts non-negative, end times after start times, percentage values between 0-1).

Appropriate Data Types: Define precise data types for all columns (e.g., VARCHAR, DECIMAL, DATE, TIME, DATETIME, BOOLEAN, INT).

4. Indexing
Primary Keys: Automatically indexed.

Foreign Keys: Create indexes on all foreign key columns to optimize join operations.

Frequently Queried Columns: Create indexes on columns commonly used in WHERE clauses, ORDER BY clauses, or for searching (e.g., clients.full_name, appointments.appointment_date, expenses.expense_date, hardware.last_maintenance_date, hardware.next_maintenance_due_date).

5. Performance and Scalability Considerations
Database Choice: Select a robust database system.

Table Partitioning/Sharding: Consider for very large or rapidly growing tables (e.g., appointments, impulses) to improve query performance and manage data volume.

Caching: Implement caching mechanisms for frequently accessed, static, or slow-changing data.

6. Archiving and Retention
Data Retention Policies: Define clear policies for how long different types of data should be retained in the active database.

Archiving Strategy: Implement a strategy for moving outdated or historical data from the primary database to a long-term, cost-effective archive.

Purging Policy: Define rules for permanently purging data that is no longer required.

7. Documentation and Monitoring
Schema Documentation:

Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagrams: Create visual representations.

Data Dictionary: Maintain a comprehensive data dictionary for each table and column (English).

Database Monitoring: Implement tools to track database performance and resource utilization.

Alerting Mechanisms: Set up alerts for critical database issues.

Audit Trails/Logging: Implement logging for critical database operations and sensitive data modifications.
